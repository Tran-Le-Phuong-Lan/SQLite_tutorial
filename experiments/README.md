# Experiment description

## Experiment 1

1. PURPOSE: Try out whether extension `sqlite-vec` can be applied to a database, so that both normal `sqlite` table and virtual table of `sqlite-vec` exist together in that one databse.

2. Must run all the `*.py` files in the directory `../prac1_Intro` before executing the code `experiment_1.py`, so the purpose is clearly shown.
